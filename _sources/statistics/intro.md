# Statistics â€” Introduction and Learning Goals

Short summary
Hands-on statistics for measurement data: distributions, descriptive stats, hypothesis testing, outliers, and the central limit theorem.

Learning objectives
- Compute and interpret mean, variance, confidence intervals.
- Apply t-tests, chi-square tests, and identify outliers.
- Relate histograms to probability distributions and sampling variability (CLT).

Key concepts (brief)
- Sampling distributions and the Central Limit Theorem.
- When to use t-distribution vs normal approximation.
- Robust statistics and practical outlier handling.

Recommended notebooks to run
- basic_statistics.ipynb
- distributions.ipynb
- t-test.ipynb
- Central_limit_theorem_illustration.ipynb
- outliers_example.ipynb and outliers_example_pairs.ipynb

Suggested exercises
- Use bootstrap or t-test to compare two small-sample datasets.
- Detect and justify removal/retention of outliers in a measurement series.

Prerequisites
Introductory probability and basic Python (NumPy, matplotlib).
