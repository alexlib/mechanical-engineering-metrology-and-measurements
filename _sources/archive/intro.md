Usage guidance

- Consider pruning outdated items and moving any still-useful notebooks into appropriate chapters.

Representative content
- archive/notebook.ipynb and markdown-notebooks in the archive build.

Suggested maintenance
- Review archive contents and either delete, refactor, or promote to a chapter with a proper intro.
