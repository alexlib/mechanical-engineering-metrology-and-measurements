# Archive — Notes and Historical Material

Short summary

Usage guidance
- Not required for the main course; consult for historical examples or auxiliary material.
- Consider pruning outdated items and moving any still-useful notebooks into appropriate chapters.

Representative content
- archive/notebook.ipynb and markdown-notebooks in the archive build.

Suggested maintenance
- Review archive contents and either delete, refactor, or promote to a chapter with a proper intro.

Prerequisites
None — archive is reference only.
