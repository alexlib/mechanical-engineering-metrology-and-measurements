# Theory â€” Introduction and Learning Goals

Short summary
This chapter covers measurement theory: uncertainty concepts, best practices, measurement-system analysis, and worked Monte Carlo examples.

Learning objectives
- Understand types of measurement uncertainty and how to report them.
- Distinguish repeatability vs reproducibility, bias, and systematic errors.
- Apply basic uncertainty propagation (analytical and Monte Carlo).
- Recognize good-practice recommendations for lab notebooks and reporting.

Key concepts (brief)
- GUM-style uncertainty vs Type A/B estimates.
- Propagation of uncertainty for slopes and model parameters.
- Role of simulations (Monte Carlo) to validate analytical propagation.

Recommended notebooks to run
- uncertainty_example.ipynb
- uncertainty_of_a_slope.ipynb
- uncertainty_propagation_monte_carlo_gum.ipynb
- teaching_measurement_uncertainty.ipynb
- best_practice_summary.ipynb

Suggested exercises
- Compute and compare analytical and Monte Carlo propagation on a simple function.
- Prepare a short lab report following the best-practice notebook checklist.

Prerequisites
Basic probability, calculus, and comfort with Python arrays.
