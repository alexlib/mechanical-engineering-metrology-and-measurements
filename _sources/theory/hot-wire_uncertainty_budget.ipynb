        "# Full Uncertainty Budget of a Hot-Wire Anemometer for Isothermal Turbulent Air Flow in a Wind Tunnel\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "For isothermal turbulent air flow measurements in a wind tunnel where air temperature increases with time due to friction, the uncertainty budget of a hot-wire anemometer becomes significantly more complex than for truly isothermal conditions. The combined standard uncertainty typically ranges from **8-15%**, with an expanded uncertainty (k=2, 95% confidence) of **16-30%** depending on the specific experimental conditions and mitigation strategies employed.[^1][^2][^3]\n",

        "1. **Pre- and post-calibration** with temperature monitoring[^15][^8]\n",
        "2. **Temperature-controlled test sections** where feasible\n",
        "3. **Rapid data acquisition** to minimize exposure to temperature drift\n",

        "\n",
        "The dominant contributors are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Frequency response limitations** (6.0%)\n",
        "2. **Non-isothermal corrections** (6.0%)\n",
        "3. **Temperature drift** (3.5%)\n",
        "4. **Calibration drift** (3.0%)\n",
        "5. **Temperature rise due to friction** (3.0%)\n",
        "\n",
        "Temperature-related effects contribute approximately **7.8%** to the combined uncertainty, while other effects contribute **8.3%**. This demonstrates that **temperature effects dominate the uncertainty budget** for non-isothermal turbulent flow measurements.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Uncertainty Reduction Strategies\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Enhanced temperature control** in the wind tunnel circuit\n",
        "2. **Improved calibration procedures** with temperature compensation\n",
        "3. **Higher-frequency CTA systems** to reduce temporal resolution errors\n",
        "4. **Shorter wire lengths** to improve spatial resolution\n",
        "5. **Real-time correction algorithms** for temperature variations\n",
        "6. **Statistical validation** through replicate measurements\n",
        "\n",
        "The uncertainty budget should be evaluated according to GUM (Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement) principles, with proper classification of Type A (statistical) and Type B (other) uncertainty components, and appropriate propagation of uncertainties through the measurement equation.[^26][^27]\n",
