    "# Standardization and Traceability\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements are useful only when they can be compared. Traceability is the property of a measurement result that provides an unbroken chain of calibrations to a reference standard, with a stated uncertainty at each step. Good traceability makes results from different labs, instruments, or times comparable and defensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points\n",
    "- Traceability links your instrument to a reference standard (ideally an SI realization) through documented calibration steps.\n",
    "- Every calibration step should include an uncertainty estimate — this is how comparability is quantified.\n",
    "- Accreditation and standards bodies provide the infrastructure and rules that make traceability reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essential organizations (one-line roles)\n",
    "1. [BIPM — Bureau International des Poids et Mesures](https://www.bipm.org/) — coordinates the international system of units (SI) and key comparisons between national metrology institutes.  \n",
    "2. National Metrology Institutes (NMIs), e.g. [NIST (US)](https://www.nist.gov/) and [NPL (UK)](https://www.npl.co.uk/) — realize national standards and provide high-quality calibrations.  \n",
    "3. [ILAC — International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation](https://ilac.org/) — promotes international acceptance of accredited laboratory results.  \n",
    "4. [ISO — International Organization for Standardization](https://www.iso.org/) — publishes standards that govern measurement and quality systems.  \n",
    "5. National standards bodies (example: [Standards Institute of Israel (SII)](https://www.sii.org.il/en/)) — implement accreditation and national policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Short student tasks\n",
    "- Trace one common lab measurement (e.g., length, mass, voltage) back to the reference standard: list each calibration step and its uncertainty.\n",
    "- Visit one organization above and write a 4–6 sentence summary of how it supports measurement comparability.\n",
    "- For a chosen calibrated sensor, sketch a minimal uncertainty budget for one calibration step (identify main uncertainty contributors).\n",
    "\n",
    "Further reading\n",
    "- GUM: \"Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement\" (BIPM/JCGM) — core guidance on uncertainty and traceability.  \n",
    "- BIPM and NMI websites — practical examples of how standards are realized and disseminated."
