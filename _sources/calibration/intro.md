# Calibration â€” Introduction and Learning Goals

Short summary
Calibration methods and error analysis for sensors: linear & nonlinear regression, hysteresis, sensitivity, and full calibration workflow.

Learning objectives
- Perform linear regression for sensor calibration and compute confidence intervals.
- Analyze hysteresis and nonlinearity errors.
- Design calibration experiments and propagate calibration uncertainty into measurements.

Key concepts (brief)
- Regression residuals, standard error, and calibration curve interpretation.
- Hysteresis and repeatability characterization.
- Sensitivity analysis and combining calibration with measurement uncertainty.

Recommended notebooks to run
- micrometer_calibration.ipynb
- regression_analysis.ipynb
- full_calibration_analysis_example.ipynb
- hysteresis_error_analysis.ipynb
- calibration_non_linear_relations.ipynb

Suggested exercises
- Calibrate a sample dataset, report calibration equation and uncertainty.
- Compare linear vs nonlinear fits and discuss choice and impact on measurements.

Prerequisites
Basic regression, statistics, and familiarity with plotting in Python.
