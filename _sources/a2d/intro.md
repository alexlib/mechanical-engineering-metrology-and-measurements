# Analog-to-Digital (A2D) â€” Introduction and Learning Goals

Short summary
Sampling, aliasing, reconstruction, and practical A/D conversion examples.

Learning objectives
- Explain sampling theorem and conditions for perfect reconstruction.
- Demonstrate aliasing and anti-aliasing requirements.
- Implement simple reconstructions (sinc/interpolation) and study errors.

Key concepts (brief)
- Nyquist frequency and aliasing examples.
- Reconstruction using sinc (Cardinal series) and practical limits.
- Quantization and its effect on measurement uncertainty (intro-level).

Recommended notebooks to run

Suggested exercises
- Create aliased and non-aliased versions of a signal and explain differences.
- Reconstruct a band-limited signal with truncated sinc and quantify error.

Prerequisites
Basic Fourier theory and sampling concepts.
