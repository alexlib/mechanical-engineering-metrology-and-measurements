# Dynamic Signals â€” Introduction and Learning Goals

Short summary
Time-domain and dynamical-system behavior: step responses, first/second order systems, and vibration-based measurements.

Learning objectives
- Interpret first- and second-order system responses and key parameters (time constant, damping, natural frequency).
- Extract physical quantities (e.g., mass from vibrations) from measured signals.
- Link time-domain responses to frequency content.

Key concepts (brief)
- Step response, log-decrement, and damping ratio estimation.
- Modal interpretation for simple systems and measurement-driven parameter estimation.
- Practical considerations: sensor dynamics and filtering.

Suggested exercises
