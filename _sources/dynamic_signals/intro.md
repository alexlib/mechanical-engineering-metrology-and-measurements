# Dynamic Signals â€” Introduction and Learning Goals

Short summary
Time-domain and dynamical-system behavior: step responses, first/second order systems, and vibration-based measurements.

Learning objectives
- Interpret first- and second-order system responses and key parameters (time constant, damping, natural frequency).
- Extract physical quantities (e.g., mass from vibrations) from measured signals.
- Link time-domain responses to frequency content.

Key concepts (brief)
- Step response, log-decrement, and damping ratio estimation.
- Modal interpretation for simple systems and measurement-driven parameter estimation.
- Practical considerations: sensor dynamics and filtering.

Recommended notebooks to run
- first_order_time_response.ipynb
- step_response.ipynb
- 2nd_order_system_step_function_log_decrement.ipynb
- mass_measurement_using_vibrations.ipynb
- design_choice_2nd_order_pressure_transducer.ipynb

Suggested exercises
- Estimate time constant and uncertainty from a noisy step response.
- Use a recorded vibration signal to estimate a lumped mass or natural frequency.

Prerequisites
Ordinary differential equations basics and elementary signal processing.
