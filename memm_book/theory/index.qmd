Rationale: this ordering lets students first acquire good lab habits and reporting skills, then build a conceptual toolbox for system analysis, then learn measurement uncertainty in increasing rigor (examples → slope propagation → Monte Carlo → case studies). Use the checklists added to notebooks to guide in-class or lab activities.
