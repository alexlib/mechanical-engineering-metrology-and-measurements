Measurements are useful only when they can be compared. Traceability is the property of a measurement result that provides an unbroken chain of calibrations to a reference standard, with a stated uncertainty at each step. Good traceability makes results from different labs, instruments, or times comparable and defensible.

Key points
- Traceability links your instrument to a reference standard (ideally an SI realization) through documented calibration steps.
- Every calibration step should include an uncertainty estimate — this is how comparability is quantified.
- Accreditation and standards bodies provide the infrastructure and rules that make traceability reliable.

Essential organizations (one-line roles)
1. [BIPM — Bureau International des Poids et Mesures](https://www.bipm.org/) — coordinates the international system of units (SI) and key comparisons between national metrology institutes.  
2. National Metrology Institutes (NMIs), e.g. [NIST (US)](https://www.nist.gov/) and [NPL (UK)](https://www.npl.co.uk/) — realize national standards and provide high-quality calibrations.  
3. [ILAC — International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation](https://ilac.org/) — promotes international acceptance of accredited laboratory results.  
4. [ISO — International Organization for Standardization](https://www.iso.org/) — publishes standards that govern measurement and quality systems.  
5. National standards bodies (example: [Standards Institute of Israel (SII)](https://www.sii.org.il/en/)) — implement accreditation and national policies.

Short student tasks
- Trace one common lab measurement (e.g., length, mass, voltage) back to the reference standard: list each calibration step and its uncertainty.
- Visit one organization above and write a 4–6 sentence summary of how it supports measurement comparability.
- For a chosen calibrated sensor, sketch a minimal uncertainty budget for one calibration step (identify main uncertainty contributors).
