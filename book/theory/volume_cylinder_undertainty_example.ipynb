    "## 1. Problem Statement: Volume of a Cylinder\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This example follows the video tutorial on YouTube: [Uncertainty Propagation Example: Volume of a Cylinder by Dr. Joshua Paul Steimel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHSOMNM6Wqk).\n",
    "\n",
    "A tube of circular cross-section has a **nominal length ($L$) of $50 \\text{ m} \\pm 0.5 \\text{ m}$** and a **radius ($R$) of $15 \\text{ m} \\pm 0.1 \\text{ m}$**. Determine the total uncertainty in the volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Given Nominal Values (Mean Values)\n",
    "\n",
    "The nominal values (mean values, denoted $\\bar{R}$ and $\\bar{L}$ in standard notation, or $r$ and $l$ in the equations) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = 15 \\text{ m}$$\n",
    "$$l = 50 \\text{ m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Given Uncertainties ($\\mu$ or $u$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The stated $\\pm$ values are the **Bias Uncertainties** (or standard uncertainty $u$ if a coverage factor is not explicitly used, as is often the case in this type of problem, represented as $u_r$ and $u_l$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_r = 0.1 \\text{ m}$$\n",
    "$$u_l = 0.5 \\text{ m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Total Uncertainty Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The total uncertainty ($\\omega_V$) is the root sum of the squares of the Bias Uncertainty ($B_V$) and the Precision Uncertainty ($P_V$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\omega_V = \\sqrt{B_V^2 + P_V^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in the video (0:09, 2:35), since there is no information given about the number of samples or standard deviation, the **Precision Uncertainty ($P_V$) is zero**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the **Total Uncertainty ($\\omega_V$) is equal to the Bias Uncertainty ($B_V$)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\omega_V = B_V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Methodology: Uncertainty Propagation (Bias Error $B_V$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Volume ($V$) of the cylinder is a function of two independent variables, radius ($r$) and length ($l$).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(r, l) = \\pi r^2 l$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bias Uncertainty ($B_V$) is calculated using the standard method for uncorrelated variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$B_V = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial r} u_r\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial l} u_l\\right)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Calculate Partial Derivatives (Sensitivity Coefficients)\n",
    "\n",
    "We first calculate the partial derivatives of the volume equation with respect to each independent variable. These are the **sensitivity coefficients** ($c_i$):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sensitivity with respect to Radius ($c_r$):**\n",
    "    $$c_r = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(\\pi r^2 l) = 2 \\pi r l$$\n",

    "    $$c_l = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial l} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial l}(\\pi r^2 l) = \\pi r^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Numerical Calculations for Total Uncertainty ($B_V$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we plug the nominal/mean values ($\\bar{r}=15 \\text{ m}$, $\\bar{l}=50 \\text{ m}$) into the partial derivatives to find the numerical sensitivity coefficients, and then calculate the total uncertainty $B_V$.\n",
