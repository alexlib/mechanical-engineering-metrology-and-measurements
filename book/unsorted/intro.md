Short summary
Collection of homework examples, exploratory notebooks, and early drafts. Use after core chapters.

How to use this folder
- Treat items here as worked problems or extra practice.
- Instructors can adapt these as homework with minor edits.

Representative notebooks
- homework_1.ipynb, homework_example_1.ipynb
- basic_error_analysis.ipynb, mean_variance_probability_function.ipynb
- doppler.ipynb, input_output_sin_1st_order.ipynb

Suggested activity
- Select one homework notebook per week and convert it into a short graded assignment with automated tests or solution notebook.

Prerequisites
Complete core chapters first (theory, statistics, a2d).
